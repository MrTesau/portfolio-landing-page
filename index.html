                After attending high school at Kaipara College, I travelled to South Africa and completed a year of
                community
                work at Vista High School.
                The majority of my time was spent assisting in the creation of a gym and fitness
                center for in need students at the local high school in the area of my birth.
                Returning back to New Zealand I began work as a farm hand at Japonica gardens before beginning tertiary
                education at Otago University. While completing my bachelor of Science I developed an interest in
                computer
                programming
                after being exposed to the language R, used in statistical analysis during laboratory exercises.
                This combined with my innate interest in the internet naturally led me to the wed development field.
                After Graduating in 2016 I took up several jobs while continuing to build my skills as a freelance web
                developer.
                I started building basic websites using wordpress but quickly began to move to learning HTML and CSS.
                Completing several online courses I eventually found and learnt to love JavaScript and in particular the
                library/framework REACT.
